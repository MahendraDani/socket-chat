# Client-Server message transmission server over TCP/IP protocol using socket programming in C

A minimal implementation of TCP/IP protocol using socket programming in C to create a message transmission application from client to server.

It's surreal that, if two machines are connected over same LAN (mobile hotspot/wifi), a communication can be established between the two machines using sockets without the need of connecting the machines physically with any wire.
